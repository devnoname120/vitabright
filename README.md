# vitabright

vitabright is a plugin enabling you to use a custom gamma table, and thus decrease brightness below the minimum, and increase it above the maximum.
**Vita OLED and 3.60 only**.

## Installation

- Download the latest version from the [Releases section](https://github.com/devnoname120/vitabright/releases).
- Extract it to `ur0:/tai/` on your Vita.
- Add `ur0:/tai/vitabright.skprx` below `*KERNEL` in the `ur0:/tai/config.txt` file.

## Usage

- Once vitabright is installed and your Vita is restarted, it will automatically work. Just open the brightness settings and move the slider.
- You can customize the gamma table that vitabright uses. Open the file `vitabright_lut.txt` and modify it according to your needs.
- Note that while there is also a file named `vitabright_lut_orig.txt`, it's not used by vitabright and it's only here for informational purposes.
